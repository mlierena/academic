# 하스켈에 영향을 받은 프로그래밍 언어들

## Functional Programming in JS

### High order function

#### Lodash : curry
* 편의 함수들을 모아놓은 라이브러리

_.curry(func, [arity=func.length])
```javascript
var abc = function(a,b,c) {
    return [a,b,c];
}

var curried = _.curry(abc)
curried(1)(2)(3);

curried(1, 2)(3);

// curried with placeholders
curried(1)(_, 3)(2)
```

#### Lodash : partial application

_.partial(func, [partials])

### Immutability

#### Object.freeze()
* Prevents new properties from being added to it
* Prevents existing properties from being removed
* Prevents existing properties, or their enumerability, configurability, or writability, from being changed


* Safe한 프로그래밍을 보장
#### Object.seal()
* Prevents new properties from being added to it
* Mark all existing properties as non-configurable
* Values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable

#### Spread Syntax (ES6)
* Allows an expression to be expanded in places where
  * multiple arguments(for function calls)
  * multiple elements(for array literals)
  * multiple variables(for destructuring assignment) are expected
* React, Redux 쪽에 많이 쓰임

#### Immutable.js
* List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record
* Efficient on modern JS VMs by using structural sharing via hash maps tries and vertor tries

#### immutability-helper 
* Mutate a copy of data without changing the original source
* Similar to MongoDB


* const, immutability-helper를 이용하면 immutable한 JS 코딩이 가능

### Lazy Evaluation 
#### Immutable.js : Seq
* Seq is immutable and lazy
  * Evaluation을 강제하는 상황에서 Eval 한다.
* JS에서도 무한리스트를 구현할 수 있다
#### Lodash: Seq
* _(value)
```javascript
_([1,2,3])
```
#### Lodash: chain
* _.chain(value)

### Type System
#### TypeScript's Nullable types
* --strictNullChecks 

### Monads
#### Generators
* Generators are functions which can be exited and later re-entered
* Their context (variable bindings) will be saved across re-entrances
#### Promise
* A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never
